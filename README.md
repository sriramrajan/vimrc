vimrc
=====

Configuration files for Vim text editor.

*vimrc*

Main configuration file for Vim. To use this file on Unix-like systems, save it
as:

`~/.vim/vimrc`

To use this file on Microsoft Windows, save it as:

`C:\Users\%USERNAME%\vimfiles\vimrc`

*gvimrc*

Configuration file for gVim. This file is used only by gVim and it is ignored
by Vim in console, it also overrides any settings from *vimrc*. To use this
file, save it in the same place as *vimrc* (see above). Note, that this file
refers to [Solarized][01] color scheme that is not installed by default. See my
[Solarized how-to note][02] for installation instruction.
