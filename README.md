vimrc
=====

Configuration files for Vim text editor.

*vimrc*

Main configuration file for Vim. To use it on Unix-like systems, save it as:

`~/.vim/vimrc`

To use it on Microsoft Windows, save it as:

`C:\Users\%USERNAME%\vimfiles\vimrc`

Note, that this file refers to [Solarized][01] color scheme that is not
installed by default.

*gvimrc*

Configuration file for gVim. This file is used only by gVim and it is ignored
by Vim in console. It also overrides any settings from *vimrc*. To use it, save
it in the same place as *vimrc* (see above).
